#What are the key issues for a portable version of the Spatial Portal?

# Introduction

What current and potentially new functionality and design points would be required for an effective portable device version of the Spatial Portal?

# Functions

  1. Map Tab
    1. Map species or genus occurrences
    1. Map occurrences in AA (default = map extent: reduced limits)
    1. Map location
    1. Map layer (subset?)?
  1. Active Area
    1. Current map extents
    1. Current location
    1. User-digitized polygon (very general - and useful in field)
  1. Pop-ups (v.basic metadata)
    1. Occurrences
    1. Location

# Design

  * Simple
  * Finger friendly
  * Reduced comms
  * Google basemaps or openxxx?
  * Start with 6 buttons covering screen (first 6 above) + EXIT + ?
  * Map uses 90% of screen at top
  * Bottom buttons are Map, AA, Exit
