# Introduction

This document briefly outlines the usage for the Prediction (using Maxent in the backend) to generate models for a species taxa and environmental predictors.


# Details

Prediction


To use Prediction (Maxent), navigate to the Prediction tab located under the 'Analysis' tab.

Step 1.
> Begin by typing in a scientific name (e.g. Macropus rufus) or a common name (e.g. Red kangaroo).
> A list of possible values will be automatically displayed for selection. Select your
> option.

> Selecting a species automatically displays the occurrence points on the map.

> Optionally, you can select a species from another tab and use that for the analysis

Step 2
> From the list of available Environmental layers, select your desired layers.

Step 3
> Select your optional parameters. This allows you to run MaxEnt with additional parameters.
> At this current stage, only a subset of the parameters are available for analysis, future
> versions may have more options available for analysis.

Step 4
> Click on the 'Start Maxent' button to run Maxent.

Output
> Once the process is completed, a prediction model is generated and displayed on the screen.
> A description, generated by Maxent, is also available for a detailed view of the analysis
> output.
