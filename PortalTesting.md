Test dates and location
21-22 June 2010,
Canberra, Epicorp building
Sessions will be recorded

# Test questions

  1. What species live in an area that you are interested in? (user can use a range of options including. ) For R4 (on Google Code)/5, there will be a number of ways that a user can define an area of interest and it will be interesting to see what approach they take. All options will be map-based but unsure till Monday how we tell users how to use it.
    1. A circular area around a point on the map (they would zoom/pan to area of interest and select point/radius (drag probably). The alternative would be to use the gazetteer search to locate a feature/place and then select an area by any methods noted here.
    1. Digitize a polygon on the map
    1. Drag a rectangle on the map or use map extent
    1. Select a polygon that is displayed on the current map (a unique polygon â€“ e.g., an LGA)
    1. Select a polygon CLASS from the displayed map (e.g., land use = forestry).
    1. One can also use the Filter tool. This generates a set of polygons on the map that represent a user-defined environmental envelope.
  1. Where has the Tasmanian devil been spotted in Australia?
  1. Find out where else in Australia the Tasmanian devil could live. (expect user to use Analysis/Prediction)
  1. Show me a map of all of the occurrences of Banjo Frogs, Striped Marsh Frogs and spotted grass frogs. Add some environmental layers to the map one at a time (e.g., temperature or rainfall).
  1. Identify what environmental characteristics occur at the locations of species X? (expect user to use Analysis/Sampling).
  1. What species occur within an environmental envelope with characteristic 1, characteristic 2, and characteristic 3? (expect user to use Analysis/Filtering)
  1. Create a set of environmental domains for Victoria (expect user to use Analysis/Classification)
  1. How would you use these tools in your work?
  1. What is missing from this tool set that you think is important for your interest or work?
