# ALA Spatial Portal Testing Sequence

This is not a comprehensive check of all functions and even less therefore of all permutations of
possible pathways through the Spatial Portal. What follows is a fair check of most of the
functionality. One hopes that if there problems exist, this scenario should find them.

  1. Add to Map | Species | “Tasmanian Devil” | Define new area | BB on Tasmania
  1. Click on point | click on scientific name | Click on View details | Assign record to ad hoc group
  1. Add records to in/out group
  1. Facet Tasmanian Devil on random legend facets | test class highlighting | test in/out selection
  1. Display uncertainty circles
  1. Check Hints area (metadata, download, scatterplot, prediction)
  1. Add to Map | Species | Create assemblage | Eucalyptus + Acacia
  1. View metadata of assemblage layer
  1. Facet on genus Hirundo (swallows) then again in legend on species. Check species selection and metadata links.
  1. On legend, select a useful point colour and size and activate animation sequence.
  1. Add to Map | Areas | Polygon
  1. Add to Map | Areas | Radius on street address | Clunies Ross Drive | Zoom to extent
  1. Add to Map | Areas | Gazetteer | Acton
  1. Add to Map | Layers | Land use
  1. Add to Map | Areas | Select area from polygonal layer (land use polygon)
  1. Add to Map | Areas | Import shapefile | demo shapefile (files area)
  1. Add to Map | Areas | Box – current view
  1. Add to Map | Areas | EE | Bio01 (3.4-9), Bio12 (900-1000) | Zoom to extent
  1. Add to Map | Layers | Best 5 + dynamic land cover (check colours, opacity, hover, metadata,  Hints)
  1. Deselect all mapped layers using the ‘Map options’ check box, then select all.
  1. Add to Map | Facet | Lifeform | Fungi + Bacteria | Facet on Lifeform/Phylum
  1. Area Report | prior area | Click # species, download | Click on #occurrences, download | Map All | Occurrences spatial valid | map all | point click record on ‘non-valid’
  1. Tools | Area report | marine | checklists, expert distributions, BioStor documents links.
  1. Tools | nearest locality | zoom in, click
  1. Tools | Scatterplot | World | Eucalyptus gunnii | polygon area of part of Tasmania | Bio01 + Bio12 + background environments | background species: Eucalyptus amygdalina. See if points from area highlighted on scatterplot. Select points on graph – check highlight on map. Species display settings | Increase size of points | Facet on IBRA | Download image | Download data. Add in/out layers.
  1. Tools | Scatterplot | Australia | Import points (demo) | Distance to any water + Weathering intensity. . Species display settings | Facet on uploaded column. Select point on graph – highlight on map.
  1. Create an Area in Oz positioned to get some common Eucalypts (to use for highlight records in area). Tools | Scatterplot List | Eucalyptus camaldulensis | Australia | Best 5 layers
  1. Tools | Tabulate | States/Territories vs CAPAD | Area | Species % | Occurrences | Download
  1. Tools | Classify | Tasmania | Best 5 + hydrological conductivity | Export set | 50 groups | Hover tool
  1. Tools | predict | Current Extent (Tas) | Eucalyptus gunnii | Best 5 + hydrological conductivity (average saturated) | Jacknife + Random 10%. Check download.
  1. Tools | Scatterplot Eucalyptus gunnii | Tasmania | My prediction + Bio01
  1. Panoramio on Oz | Zoom to small area | Click on image | Click on image title | Click on author.
  1. Map options: Outline, Minimal (OpenStreetmap), Normal (Google normal), Satellite (Google Satellite). Check metadata.
  1. Import | Assemblage | demo (Eric Woehler’s bird species) | World. Facet on Order.
  1. Import | Areas | Shapefile | demo.
  1. Import | Areas | KML | demo.
  1. Import | Areas | WKT | demo paste from prompt
  1. Export | Map | lat/long | jpg | screen
  1. Export | Map | pdf | print
  1. Export | Checklist | Current (small area extent marine) | Download – check against Tools | Area report
  1. Export | Point sample | World | Random coordinates (http://spatial.ala.org.au/files/Demo_Random_100x9v.csv (random terrestrial and marine) | All layers (select first and Shift last). Check ranges of environmental sand spot check classes of contextuals in Excel.
  1. Export | Areas | All areas | Shapefile/WKT/KML, delete all layers and then Import | Areas for each.
  1. Help. Random pages
